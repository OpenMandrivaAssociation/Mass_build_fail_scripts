# Mass_build_fail_scripts
A couple of scripts to help with mass build failures analysis.
Then can be run with the failed_builds_list.txt file (generated by abf) as an argument and will pick the failures out of the build list files.
There is a partial file of output from the mass build that completed on 13/07/18 this failed on line 210 with the following error.
./failed_build_sheet_with_case.sh: line 210: [: too many arguments
